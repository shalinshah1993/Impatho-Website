					<!-- Reference :- http://www.irinnews.org/report/79916/nigeria-sickle-cell-disorder-killing-100-000-infants-a-year -->
					According to the WHO, 200,000 infants are born with sickle-cell in Africa every year, with Nigeria accounting for about three-quarters of these births. Sixty percent of the 200,000 will die as infants. Nigeria accounts for 75 percent of infant sickle-cell cases in Africa and almost 80 percent of infant deaths are because of this disease, in the continent.

					<h5>Challenges</h5>

					Basic education, healthcare, sanitation, drinking water, elec- tricity etc. are some of the fundamental needs of people living in any continent, country or terrain. These are much more serious challenges than computer literacy, Internet of Things (IoT) and ”One Laptop Per Child” mission. Each of these problem is so petty and yearned for that it has become too difficult to be solved. 

					As per the WHO statistics 2013, total global expenditure on health as % of gross domestic product (GDP) was 9.2 in 2010. In developed countries like America, this total expenditure in health is 14.3% of GDP while it is only 6.2% in African region and 3.6% in South-East Asia. Poverty, illiteracy and unawareness of healthcare solutions are some of the key reasons for such an imbalance. This shows that in developing countries of the world, it is indispensable to find a cheap, efficient and reliable healthcare solution.

					<h5>Our Solution Impatho</h5>

					ImPatho is an image processing based pathological decision support system for disease identification. A device to get magnified image of stained blood sample is designed and developed. In our engineering problem of healthcare governance, we have selected Sickle Cell Anemia, a haemoglobin disorder, as one representative life threatening disease since the most prevalent disease in African countries is Sickle Cell Anemia. he executive summary of WHO states that in several countries, 10% − 40% of the population carries sickle-cell anemia, a haemoglobin disorder, resulting in estimated Sickle-cell disease (SCD) prevalence of at least 2%. Unlike what is generally perceieved, there are easy and accurate ways to expedite the process of diagnosing RBC disorders like Sickle Cell Anemia, Macrocytes, Microcytes etc., without any human intervention.

					The tool which we developed makes an attempt to overcome some of the existing loopholes, thereby providing a simple, lucid, aesthetic and robust solution to the problem of collecting and analysing healthcare data.
